# Aris

Aris is a low-level messaging protocol loosely based on the [Pusher Protocol](https://pusher.com) and [Discord&apos;s Gateway Protocol](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway). While designed with WebSocket use in mind, Aris can be applied for local messaging or any other usage you might dream up.

The protocol can be found in `PROTOCOL.md`. This repository also contains the async Rust library for the protocol.
